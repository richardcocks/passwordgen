# Fixing a password generator

I've been [nerd-sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by co-pilot. I don't normally have it enabled, but was working on another machine which did. I was implementing a feature when it suggested autocompleting GeneratePassword.

It took me on a journey of benchmarking with BenchmarkDotNet and discovering what did and did not affect performance in microbenchmarking.

## Co-pilot output

The original suggestion, straight from co-pilot was:

```csharp
public string GeneratePassword(int length)
{
    string password = "";
    string characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+";
    System.Random random = new System.Random();

    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        password += characters[random.Next(characters.Length)];
    }
    return password;
}

```
